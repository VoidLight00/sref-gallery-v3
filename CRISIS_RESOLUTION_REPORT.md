## 🎯 Crisis Analysis: "진실모드" (Truth Mode)

### Initial State Assessment
- **Original Problem**: Images completely non-functional (100% failure rate)
- **Navigation**: All category routes returned 404 errors
- **Functionality**: All buttons were "pure decoration" - no actual handlers
- **Data**: Only 10 hardcoded fake entries
- **Architecture**: No backend, no database, no real functionality
- **Reality Check**: 0.5% complete despite appearing "finished"

### User Feedback Translation
- **"진실모드"** → Demand for brutal honest assessment of actual state
- **"전혀 안보이고 카테고리 작동안하고... 다 안하는데?"** → Nothing visible, categories broken, nothing works
- **MCP + 에이전트 적극활용** → Aggressive use of MCP tools and agents for systematic resolution
